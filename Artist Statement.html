<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<br>
	<h3>My work doesn’t have any meaning in particular. I don’t think about a specific vision. I try to stay away from social issues. I don’t draw for a purpose. I don’t draw only to further an agenda. I simply draw what I want to draw. If I want to draw a princess, I will draw a princess. If I want to draw a ninja, I will draw a ninja. To be very honest, I never really worried about the “artistic" side of art. I started doing art simply by doodling things that I wanted to doodle. Most of the time, that meant cartoon and anime characters, as well as my own characters. I only decided to descend further into art studies so I could better draw cool things.  Personally, I'm not exactly fond of the idea of "high art." I don't believe that art should be something only for critics for enjoy. I believe that art should be something that everyone can enjoy.  When I create, I create for the enjoyment of myself and for the enjoyment of others. If I want to communicate something, I won’t make weird art showcases, with crazy and abstract imagery. I’d much rather write a story, or draw a comic. 
<br> <br>
	My main inspiration comes from an artist by the name of Kienan Lafferty, otherwise known as KNKL. He’s a character artist who has his roots in doodling characters he likes. Eventually, he was able to become a big name artist in the game industry, and runs a mostly successful youtube channel on the side. He inspires me because he’s just a nerd who likes to draw. He truly loves drawing, and loves making things that people can enjoy. The discovery of his channel when I was still in highschool inspired me to pick up art, and drove me to pursue something I would enjoy
<br> <br>
	My dream is to one day be someone who can inspire younger generations to simply follow their dreams. For them to draw what they enjoy, and not be limited by what’s considered “artsy” by the art world, because to me, art is something to be enjoyed by everyone.</h3>
